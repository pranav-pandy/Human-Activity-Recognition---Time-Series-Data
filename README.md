# ‚è±Ô∏è Human Activity Recognition Using Time Series Classification

This project focuses on the classification of human physical activities using time-series data collected from wearable sensors. The goal is to accurately identify different activities based on statistical time-domain features extracted from multivariate sensor readings.

---

## üìö Overview

Human activity data is collected from a wireless sensor network and includes six time-series signals per instance. The project involves:

- Extracting meaningful time-domain features from raw time series
- Building binary and multiclass classification models
- Evaluating model performance using ROC, AUC, and cross-validation

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI AReM Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+%28AReM%29)
- **Activities**: Walking, Sitting, Standing, Lying, Bending1, Bending2, Cycling
- **Structure**:
  - 88 instances across 7 activity folders
  - Each instance contains 6 time series of 480 readings each
  - Signals include: avg_rss12, var_rss12, avg_rss13, var_rss13, avg_rss23, var_rss23

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Extraction

Statistical time-domain features were computed for each of the 6 time series in every instance:

- Minimum, Maximum, Mean, Median
- Standard Deviation, First Quartile, Third Quartile

The resulting feature matrix is used for training classification models.
